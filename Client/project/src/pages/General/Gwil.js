        Work Integrated Learning (WIL) involves merging academic learning with
        hands-on work experience. The objective of WIL is to offer students
        practical, real-world exposure that enriches their comprehension of
        theoretical concepts and readies them for the challenges of the
        professional environment. This educational method is crafted to close
        the divide between theory and practice, enabling students to apply their
        knowledge in a professional context.
