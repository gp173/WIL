          Work-integrated learning for organizations involves the seamless
          integration of work experience and practical training into educational
          and professional development initiatives. Students and participants
          will get the opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge in a
          real-world work environment through this collaborative approach
          between educational institutions and enterprises. A link between
          academic learning and the practical skills required in the workplace
          is provided by these programmes, which include apprenticeships,
          cooperative education, internships, and other hands-on experiences. In
          addition to giving students invaluable industry exposure and practical
          skills, work-integrated learning builds a mutually beneficial
          relationship that improves learning outcomes and workforce readiness.
          For organisations, it presents an opportunity to identify and
          potentially hire talented individuals.
