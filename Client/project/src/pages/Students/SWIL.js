          WIL, or Work-Integrated Learning, is an exciting opportunity for
          students to bridge the gap between theory and practice. It's a
          hands-on approach to education where you get to apply what you've
          learned in real-world settings. Whether through internships, co-op
          programs, or practical projects, WIL allows you to gain valuable
          experience, develop essential skills, and build a strong foundation
          for your future career. It's a chance to connect classroom knowledge
          with the professional world, making your learning journey more dynamic
          and rewarding.
